Name: Steam Friends Finder

Description:
Our project is an implementation project that works with Social Networks and Recommendations. We use the Steam WebAPI to recommend friends to an inputted user. We created a simple version of the Strong Triadic Closure: by taking the user's 10 most played games on Steam and going through each friend's friends, we recommend that the user add any of the top 5 users that we recommend. Our recommendation algorithm is simple: each friend's friend gets a score that is equal to the amount of minutes played for each of the original user's top 10 games.

Work Breakdown:
Reifon: Used Postman to determine API outputs. Outlined the initial approach to the project and managed API calls and arguments. Debugged code, commented the code, and fixed code style. Wrote summary.txt.

Leon: Developed the GUI, which includes grabbing all the information and displaying it. Wrote usermanual.

David: Wrote the core functions. Chose the data structures to use, and managed the logic. Also added the loading GIF. Debugged code.
